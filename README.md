# ARMultiuser
This sample app demonstrates a simple shared AR experience for two or more iOS 12 devices. Before exploring the code, try building and running the app to familiarize yourself with the user experience it demonstrates:

1、Run the app on one device. You can look around the local environment, and tap to place a virtual 3D character on real-world surfaces. (Tap again to place multiple copies of the character.)

2、Run the app on a second device. On both device screens, a message indicates that they have automatically joined a shared session.

3、Tap the Send World Map button on one device. Make sure the other device is in an area that the first device visited before sending the map, or has a similar view of the surrounding environment.

4、The other device displays a message indicating that it has received the map and is attempting to use it. When that process succeeds, both devices show virtual content at the same real-world positions, and tapping on either device places virtual content visible to both.
